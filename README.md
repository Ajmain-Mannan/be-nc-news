To be able to run this database you must create two .env files (.env.test and .env.development) and store them within the root of the project directory. In each file, set PGDATABASE=database_name depending on which database you are using for testing and development.
You may then run setup-dbs in the terminal and should recieve a response notifying you that the databases have been created.
